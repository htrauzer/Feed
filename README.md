# 🏛️ Go Feed Project
A full-stack web forum built with **Go (Golang)**, featuring real-time data persistence with **SQLite** and containerized deployment via **Docker**. This project allows users to share posts, categorize discussions, and interact through likes and comments.

## 🚀 Features

* Persistent Storage:   Data is stored in an SQLite database that survives container restarts.
* Interactive Content:  Users can create posts, leave comments, and react (Like/Dislike).
* Clean Architecture:   Separation of concerns between Handlers, Database logic, and Utils.
* Containerized:        Fully Dockerized for easy setup and deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
